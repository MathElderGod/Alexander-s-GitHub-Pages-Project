## About Me as A Person:

I am a 27-year-old hispanic white male who comes from a poor family. Growing up poor was kind of difficult. However, I never allowed my
circumstances to prevent me from becoming someone of value or inpirational. **I am married**, and __I have two children__. My first born is a boy, and he turns 3 on october first. My second born is a girl, and she turns 1 on november the third. 

*Being a parent has been a beautiful and wonderful experience*, but somtimes it can be a bit challenging. I first started attending college in 2017 and i recently graduated with 4 associates degrees. _My associates degrees are in the following fields: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and University Math/Science._ ~~I worked my butt off to graduate with distinctrion in all four of my degrees.~~ I hope that this may provide some information about my work ethic. 

**I joined the military when I was 18, and I served as an _Infantry Mortarman in the US ARMY_. I got out the military with an expert Infantrymans Badge and a few memorable medals.** As a veteran, I really strive to make an impression. I am highly disciplined and responsible. The military has instilled various values in my ethos like: <sub>duty, honor, integrity, respect, bravery, resciliency, and more.</sub> I sometimes find myself missing the military, <sup>but I then come to my senses and think: boy I am high!</sup> Serving is not easy, and it is a lifestyle I valued while it lasted. 

You might be thinking: Man! Alexander sure is a bit of a showoff. However, tragedy can stike anyone. Last year, in the summer of 2021, **I was diagnosed with cancer.** After being convinced by family, I decided to attend the fall quarter of 2021 and fight cancer at the same time! **Word of advice: DON'T FIGHT CANCER AND GO TO SCHOOL!** After beating cancer and getting straight A's, I found myself riddled with trauma and depression. 

> Never be game over! 

This is one of the most prominant quotes from my favorite videogame series:
> Metal Gear Solid. 

I decided to take the winter quarter off this year, but decided to reattend during the spring semester. I hit remission in winter 2022. I hope that my experiences can show you a thing or two about my character and personality.
